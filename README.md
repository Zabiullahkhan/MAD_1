## Project Statement
### Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform

It's a platform to connect Sponsors and Influencers so that sponsors can get their product/service advertised and influencers can get monetary benefit.

#### Frameworks to be used
These are the mandatory frameworks on which the project has to be built.
  Flask for application code
  Jinja2 templates + Bootstrap for HTML generation and styling
  SQLite for data storage

**Note:** All demos should be possible on your local machine.

#### Roles
The platform will have three roles;

****Admin** - root access**
  An admin can monitor all the users/campaigns, see all the statistics
  Ability to flag inappropriate campaigns/users

****Sponsors** - a company/individual who wants to advertise their product/service**
  Sponsors will create campaigns, search for influencers and send ad requests for a particular campaign.
  Sponsors can create multiple campaigns and track each individual campaign.
  They can accept ad requests by influencers for public campaigns.
  Each Sponsor may have;
    Company Name / Individual Name
